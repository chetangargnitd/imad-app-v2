                    Life is something we all share, 
                    Just like oxygen, in the air. 
                    The way we live it, is up to us, 
                    With a negative or with a plus
                </p>
                <p>
                   Life is something, we should cherish, 
                    We never know, when we'll perish. 
                    Live each and every single day, 
                    Smell the flowers, stop and play. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Life is something, we've been blessed, 
                    Choice is yours, choose your quest. 
                    Follow your passions, and you'll be fine, 
                    With the right attitude, you will shine.
